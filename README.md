**INSTALLATION** 

- Drag and drop the Configuration folder into your project and initialize it.
- Then link the delegate protocol for accessing the delegate methods. 
- let's implement the drawer view object and set delecate to current view controller.
- Connect the tab bar controller with your view controller in StoryBoard
- show the Navigation drawer (drawerVw.show())

        drawerVw = DrawerView(aryControllers:DrawerArray.array, isBlurEffect:true, isHeaderInTop:false, controller:self)
        drawerVw.delegate = self
        drawerVw.changeUserName(name: "Sowrirajan Sugumaran")
        drawerVw.show()
        
Push the viewcontroller which is selected by user.

        func pushTo(viewController: UIViewController) {
        self.navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
        }

Denote the storyboard of viewcontrollers which wnat you show on SPNavigationDrawer.
 
        struct DrawerArray {
        static let array:NSArray = ["MyAccount", "Offers", "History","Offers", "Language", "Settings", "History"]
        }
